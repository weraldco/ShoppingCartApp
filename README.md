# Shopping Cart App or E-commerce Website.

As I go deeper in React, I challenge my self to build a Shopping Cart App, it's very common to everyone but for me, I just want to practice in this project. This one is build in React Vite using Typescript with Redux Toolkit and no Database (I will try to rebuild this in NextJS). As I build this project, I learn how the code works, I learn how the typescript is very useful, I learn problem solving for all the bugs I'm facing. The design is not the polish, I just focus on how to build this project more.

Note the the favorites Page is not yet working.
